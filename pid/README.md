# Guess the PID


This mini game that our teacher explained to us consisted of guessing the PID of the script that was being executed, that is to say, the user had to indicate a number and given that number if it was the PID of the script that was being executed, it had to warn you, otherwise it had to indicate if the number was too small or too high compared to the number of the PID.


The only data he gave us was how to get the PID of the script:

```
$$
```


## Notes

Once the script was finished, he told me that he would like a message to appear when the user has tried several times.
